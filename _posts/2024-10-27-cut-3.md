Hi everyone,

Over the past few months, I've been working on enhancing the **CUT** algorithms in Lemuroid. For those unfamiliar, CUT (Cheap Upscaling Triangulation) is a family of upscaling techniques that transform pixelated games, giving them a modern HD appearance.

I started this quest by completely **rewriting CUT2**, making it faster and significantly better at handling antialiased edges. This brings noticeable improvements to modern games and in games with mixed 2D and 3D content, like the classic Final Fantasy titles on PSX.

Building on that, I developed a new variant, **CUT3**. While slightly slower, CUT3 has the ability to approximate edges at any angle, improving shapes especially in retro games.

I'm sharing a [**demo web app**](https://swordfish90.github.io/cheap-upscaling-triangulation/) where you can see the new shaders in action. It showcases how the filters look on a wide range of games, from the 8-bit era to modern titles.

As always, the code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Swordfish90/cheap-upscaling-triangulation) under the GPL3 license. Feel free to check additional details or use it in your own open-source projects.

These enhancements are already available in **Lemuroid 1.16.2**, so make sure to update the app and let me know what you think.

Enjoy more games in HD!
