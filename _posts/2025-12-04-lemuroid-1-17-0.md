It has been ages since I last wrote on this blog, but **Lemuroid 1.17.0** is rolling out now in beta and that deserves a post.

Headline changes:

* Added microphone support for Nintendo DS
* Deprecated DeSmuME, now replaced by MelonDS
* Completely redesigned touch controls
* Added immersive mode with dynamic background color (as you can see in the pic)
* Slightly improved HD mode
* Added quicksave/quickload gamepad shortcuts
* Added support for 16Kb pages
* Updated all cores and databases
* Various UI/UX improvements

A lot of work also went under the hood to modernize the app: the mobile UI is now 100% Jetpack Compose (TV is still pending) and the controls have been completely redesigned.

On a personal note, a lot has changed this year; the latest is that I'm cofounding a company called **GCast** with a dear friend, and I'm excited to share more very soon.

You can grab the beta on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.swordfish.lemuroid). As soon as it gets a little bit of testing, you'll find 1.17.0 on [Github](https://github.com/Swordfish90/Lemuroid/releases/tag/1.17.0) and [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.swordfish.lemuroid/) alongside the usual channels.

Enjoy!
